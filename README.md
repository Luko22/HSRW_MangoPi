# HSRW_MangoPi
We are HSRWMangoPi. We chose challenge#1 and decided to explore the topic of Urban Innovation with Open Data. For this we plan on training an ML model to model the risk for drivers based on static and dynamic conditions. We ultimately aim to use the data to create policies for better traffic conditions and practices.
